      <h2>Weekly Notes</h2>
      <p>I learn things when I write them. Here are some of my writings. I update my writings weekly.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Article 1 - <a href="course\weekly_notes\weekly_notes-1.pdf">Finding Irreducible Polynomials(I)</a></li>
        <li>Article 2 - <a href="course\weekly_notes\weekly_notes-2.pdf">Finding Irreducible Polynomials(II)</a></li>
        <li>Article 3 - <a href="course\weekly_notes\weekly_notes-3.pdf">Berlekampâ€™s Algorithm for Factoring Polynomials</a></li>

      <h2>Papers to Look</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Timing Attacks on Implementations of Diffie-Hellman, RSA, DSS, and Other Systems</li>
            Summary: One of the first papers to report attacks on Cryptographic protocols using methods other than social engineering. This piece of research talks about attacks that can be initiated by knowing the computation time, which comes under the class of side-channel attacks.
        <li>Flipping Bits in Memory Without Accessing Them: An Experimental Study of DRAM Disturbance Errors</li>
            Summary: Authors have described attacks on newer hardware based on laws of physics, specifically occurring due to interaction between charged/discharged capacitors, which are being used in DRAM in recent times. The "Row Hammer Attack" is implemented in systems, and results show that newer systems are prone to this attack.
        <li>Scalable Quantum Simulation of Molecular Energies</li>
            Summary: Reports the calculation of the first-ever electronic structure using NISQ (Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum) system using the Unitary Coupled Cluster(UCC) method using the Variational Quantum Eigensolver(VQE) algorithms up to a good chemical accuracy. This shows that Simulation problems can be computed efficiently in Quantum Computers.</li>
